        The idea is to make a horizontal or vertical line of matching colors by swapping them between the triangular sections.
      </p>
      <p>
        After clicking on a tile, 3 others become bigger, these are tiles you can swap with.
      </p>
      <p>
        Swapping 2 tiles of the same color will transform them both into a random color for 5 points.
      </p>
      <p>
        After you have made a line, the tiles will be replaced randomly and you will receive 10 points per tile.
